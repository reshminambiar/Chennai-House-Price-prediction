# Chennai-House-Price-prediction
Real estate transactions are quite opaque sometimes and it
may be difficult for a newbie to know the fair price of any given
home. Thus, multiple real estate websites have the functionality
to predict the prices of houses given different features
regarding it. Such forecasting models will help buyers to identify
a fair price for the home and also give insights to sellers as to
how to build homes that fetch them more money.This is a full-fledged data science 
project to predict house prices in Chennai which includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and 
model building. Python and its major libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn,
matplotlib and sklearn and statsmodel packages have been used in this 
project.
